WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Dadingdang/Xilinx Project/ES_design/ES_design.srcs/constrs_1/new/EGo1.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/main_progress_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
